# Understand_NLP
Here I have worked with Natural Language Processing fundamentals. Initlially, I had built a web scraper which had scraped news 
articles from Inshorts website. 
Then I have used numerous text-preprocessing techniques, through which I was able to clean the data for further processing.
After this, I have done sentiment analysis on the data.
For this, I have used NLTK and TextBlob library. Using both data visualization and pandas dataframe to show results of the dataset.

The sentiment score of different genres of news category is shown with the help of the following plots.

Lastly, the count of three sentiments in different genres of news articles is depicted with the help of factor or bar plot.
