# Understand_NLP
Here I have worked with Natural Language Processing fundamentals. Initlially, I had built a web scraper which had scraped news 
articles from Inshorts website. 
Then I have used numerous text-preprocessing techniques, through which I was able to clean the data for further processing.
After this, I have done sentiment analysis on the data.
For this, I have used NLTK and TextBlob library. Using both data visualization and pandas dataframe to show results of the dataset.
